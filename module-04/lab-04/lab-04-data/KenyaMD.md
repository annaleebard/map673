# Visualizing Kenyan HIV Prevelance by Gender

The HIV pandemic is most severe in sub-Sahara Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that Africa is home to three out of four HIV related deaths in 2014. African women remain at a much higher risk of infection and HIV remains the leading cause of death of women of the reproductive age. Still, women are not receiving life-saving services, antiretroviral treatment, testing, and education. Planning for delivery of services is an immense task and African countries are often employing global or regional data in service development and deployment. There are local trends in HIV infection that, once visualized, can maximize the benefit of services provided.

Of 54 African countries Kenya ranks 11th in HIV prevalence. [Kenya’s Open Data Portal](https://opendata.go.ke/) houses collections of data stretching across many themes and provided in easily accessible data structures. Web searches have yielded several static maps of HIV related data in Kenya. However, the gender disparities of HIV infection have not been highlighted in the maps discovered. Kenya’s data portal provides a “Gender based HIV prevalence per county” data set I will use to explore Kenya’s local environment of HIV prevalence and gender. The goal of this project is to visualize, via interactive web-map, HIV occurrence by gender and Kenyan county.
